#   ***Higher Order Components***

- HOC is simply a function which accepts Component as argument and returns new Component.
- We should not change the given component

***Things to remember while working with HOC***

1.  Don't mutate orginal component
2.  Pass unrelated props
3.  Don't use HOC inside render method
4.  Refs should not be passed
